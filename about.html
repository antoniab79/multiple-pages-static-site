    <p>
      Creme patisserie started in 1926 when the pastry chefs Esther and Theo
      Gyseghem moved to London and opened a Belgian patisserie on the corner of
      Dean Street and Old Compton Street in Soho...
      <br />
      Creme patisserie has grown to be one of the most loved bakeries in the UK,
      with patisseries spanning throughout the UK and Ireland. One of the key
      factors of our success has been to build a strong reputation based on the
      quality of our lovingly handmade cakes and patisseries, using only the
      freshest ingredients and traditional baking methods. From stunning whole
      cakes, to delicate patisseries, to our famous afternoon teas, we believe
      we have the perfect range of treats to delight all of our loyal customers
      both old and new.
